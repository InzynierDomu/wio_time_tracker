## Manual
#### **Required Components**  
To operate the device, an SD card is required with two configuration files, which can be found in the `SD_example` folder.  

#### **WiFi Configuration**  
`wifi.json` The device needs a WiFi network name and password to connect to the internet and synchronize its time and date.  

#### **Timer Configuration**  
`config.json` contains a list of timers categorized into three groups.  

#### **Device Operation**  
- After powering on, categories can be switched using the top buttons.  
- Timers within a category can be navigated using the up and down arrows.  
- To start or stop a timer, press the center button on the joystick.  
- When a timer is running, the total daily value can be manually adjusted with right/left arrows.  
- The display shows two timers:  
  - **Current session time** at the top.  
  - **Total time for the day** at the bottom.  

#### **Data Storage**  
- Timer results are saved on the SD card with filenames corresponding to the date.  
- The saved format is currently Markdown (`.md`), compatible with the <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>.

### **Using the Saved Files in Obsidian**  
- The `.md` files could be moved to a folder within your Obsidian vault.  
- Once in Obsidian, these files can be utilized with plugins like **Database** and **Chart** to generate visualizations.
